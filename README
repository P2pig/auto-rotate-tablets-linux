# Automatic screen rotation for convertible PCs.

Some linux distros like Lubuntu who has Lqtx doesn't allow to auto-rotate screen.
So I've gathered some scripts into one to make it automatically rotate

# Auto Screen Rotation script used

# Screen rotation with all pointers 
https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/tree/master/contrib/rotate-screen

Simply put them together and you have a fully working script.
